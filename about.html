      Pecko is a small project made by Jack Blazer(me) What we do is create websites for free. All you have to do is give us the general idea of your website, your email. and your all set. we will make it as quickly as possible.
     It is developed Copletely by Jack blazer. I am a small programmer that specializes in Html, CSS, and JS. I am making this as a way to help others while practicing my skills as a programmer. On the submit idea page you can submit yourwebsite idea along with email so i can email you when its finished and send the html file.
     My goal is to help others create websites. People who dont know programming but want a website done for them

    <h1>About jack</h1> <br>
    <p class = "text">
      I am a boy from ohio. I love coding in my free time and am still learning new things everyday. I want to help people who don't have the same kind of knowledge about coding as me build websites, so i am making Pecko to help that. Hobbies that arent coding for me are baseball, and sleeping. i have a small youtube channel where i post coding videos and gaming because thats another hobby of mine. I love playing minecraft and rythm games. my favorites are: Geometry dash, OSU!, fnf, and quaver. I also like minecraft, and call of duty warzone
